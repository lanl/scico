`SCICO <https://github.com/lanl/scico>`__ is a Python package
for solving the inverse problems that arise
in scientific imaging applications.
Its primary focus is providing methods
for solving ill-posed inverse problems
by using an appropriate prior model of the reconstruction space.
SCICO includes a growing suite of operators, cost
functionals, regularizers, and optimization routines that may be
combined to solve a wide range of problems and is designed so that it is
easy to add new building blocks.

SCICO's main advantages are:

   - Operators in SCICO are defined using a simple, NumPy-like syntax,
     yet automatically benefit from GPU/TPU acceleration and
     `just-in-time compilation
     <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html#using-jit-to-speed-up-functions>`__
   - SCICO can compute the adjoint of linear operators automatically,
     which saves time when defining new operators.
   - SCICO's operator calculus makes code for optimization routines
     look like the pseudocode in scientific papers.
   - SCICO provides state-of-the-art optimization routines,
     including projected gradients
     and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
     with the flexibility of plug-and-play priors
     including BM3D :cite:`dabov-2008-image` and DnCNN :cite:`zhang-2017-dncnn` denoisers.

Inverse Problems
----------------

SCICO is designed to solve inverse problems such as

.. math::

   \argmin_{\mb{x}} \; f(\mb{x}) + g(C \mb{x}) \;,

where :math:`\mb{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}` represents the reconstruction,
e.g., a 1D signal, 2D image, 3D volume, or 3D+time volume sequence,
:math:`C: \mathbb{R}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}^{m}`
is a regularization operator,
and :math:`f: \mathbb{R}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}`
and :math:`g: \mathbb{R}^{m} \to \mathbb{R}`
are functionals associated with the data fidelity
and regularization term, respectively.

In a typical computational imaging problem,
we have a `forward model` that models the data acquisition process.
We denote this forward model
by the (possibly nonlinear) operator :math:`A`.
We want to find :math:`\mb{x}`
such that :math:`\mb{y} \approx A(\mb{x})`
in some appropriate sense.
This discrepency is measured in our data fidelity, or `loss`, function

.. Math::
   f(\mb{x}) = L(A(\mb{x}), \mb{y}) \;,

where :math:`L` is a `functional` that maps a vector (or array)
into a scalar.
A common choice is :math:`f(\mb{x}) = \norm{\mb{y} - A(\mb{x})}_2^2`.
Note that :math:`f(\mb{x})` can often be interpreted
as the negative log likelihood of the candidate :math:`\mb{x}`,
given the measurements :math:`\mb{y}` and an underlying noise model.
The SCICO :class:`.Loss` object encapsulates
the data :math:`\mb{y}`,
the forward model :math:`A`,
and the functional :math:`L` in a single object.
A library of functionals and losses are implemented
in :mod:`.functional` and :mod:`.loss`, respectively.

The functionals :math:`g(\cdot)` or :math:`g(C (\cdot))`
are regularization functionals, and the :math:`C` are operators,
usually linear operators.
Together, these terms encourage solutions that are "simple" in some sense.
A popular choice is to let :math:`g = \norm{ \cdot }_1`
and :math:`C` be a :class:`.FiniteDifferece` linear operator,
which promotes piecewise smooth solutions
to the inverse problem.

For more detail in these classes, see :ref:`classes`.


Usage Examples
--------------

Usage examples are available as Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks.
Example scripts are located in ``examples/scripts``.
The corresponding Jupyter Notebooks
are provided in the ``scico-data`` submodule
and symlinked to ``examples/notebooks``.
They are also viewable on
`GitHub <https://github.com/lanl/scico-data/tree/main/notebooks>`_
and in the documentation under :ref:`example_notebooks`.


Related Projects
----------------

The SCICO library is inspired by the
`GlobalBiolm <https://biomedical-imaging-group.github.io/GlobalBioIm/>`_
MATLAB package,
which provides a similar object-oriented design
for solving computational imaging problems.
`Pycsou <https://matthieumeo.github.io/pycsou/html/index>`_
is a similar Python library for inverse problems
that is also inspired by GlobalBioIm.

A key advantage of SCICO over these libraries is the usage of
`JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/>`_,
which provides
automatic hardware acceleration,
automatic differentiation,
and automatic adjoint calculations.
Moreover, beause JAX is a machine learning library,
it enables implementation and training
of state of the art plug-and-play regularizers such as DnCNN.
